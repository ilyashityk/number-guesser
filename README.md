Number Guesser on Python
I present to you the program I wrote "Number Guesser". The user partially selects the range of the hidden number (from 1 to n),
after which he tries to guess this number. During the execution of the program, it will give him hints more than the hidden number or less than the entered one. 
Also, the game is equipped with "fool protection" and when an incorrect number/character/string is entered,
the player is informed about this and the program asks to enter the correct value.
